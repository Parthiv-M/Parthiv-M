# ðŸ•· Let's do this one ~~last~~ more time

My name is Parthiv Menon. I was bitten by the development bug back in college. And for the last few years, I have been honing my skills as one among many full-stack developers. I think you would know the rest. I am passionate about any software project that gets my creative juices flowing. I learnt to handle production deployments crashing on AWS. Dealt with failing CIs. Got into the never ending spiral of Javascript and CSS libraries and realised the enormous importance of both their basics. And when I felt ready to take on the world, I got involved in the open source community. It gives people the belief that _anyone_ can be the change the world wants to see.

## So, what do I do?
- **Programming languages** Python â€¢ Typescript â€¢ PHP â€¢ Bash
- **Frontend stack** NextJS â€¢ ReactJS â€¢ Tailwind â€¢ SCSS â€¢ ShadCN
- **Backend stack** NodeJS â€¢ ExpressJS â€¢ FastAPI

- **DevOps and cloud** Github CI/CD â€¢ Vercel â€¢ AWS â€¢ Terraform 
- **Design** Figma â€¢ Adobe Photoshop
